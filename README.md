# NodeJS_ReactJS_Videocall
NodeJS React Video Calling. 

This application demonstrates how to create an app that allows users to make real-time video calls to friends without registering to use the app.  

Simply send your friend the appâ€™s auto-generated unique ID to make the call.   

Every time you open a new tab, the server gives you a totally different unique ID.
